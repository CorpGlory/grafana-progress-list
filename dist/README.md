# Progress List Panel

## About

A panel showing list of progress-like list items in one board.

## How To Use


  * Create a metric query where result looks like this: `[(time, key, value)]`
  * Goto "Options" tab and choose aggregation function and other options

More info in [**tutorials**](https://github.com/CorpGlory/grafana-progress-list/wiki)

Progress list will try to aggregate all values by key using chosen aggregate function.

Progress list can be thought of as many simple [Singlestat Panels](http://docs.grafana.org/features/panels/singlestat/). But items are generated from the query, rather than defined manually.
